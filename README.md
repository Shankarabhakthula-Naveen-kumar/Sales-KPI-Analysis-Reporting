# Sales-KPI-Analysis-Reporting
This project processes raw retail data to generate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). It cleans the data and calculates Actual vs. Target for sales and units, providing performance segmentation by Product and Region. The result is a set of BI-ready tables for a dynamic sales dashboard.
